Machine learning model based on differnt neural network to classify the artistic current of paintings

In this project I trained several neural networks to be able to correctly classify the artistic current of the painting. The framework DB was downloaded from Kaggle. There are 14 classes under examination. Different activation functions and different hype parameters have been compared.
